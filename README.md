# Hello and welcome ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lubeck; I'm a **Software Developer** and **Backend Engineer** with 7 years of Software Engineering and Software Development experience. I specialize in **Architecting** and **Implementing Performant Web Services**.

Over the years, I've been lucky enough to mentor, and guide junior engineers, collocated and distributed across multiple time zones. In recent years, I've focused on using [**Go**](https://go.dev), [**Java**] and **Amazon Web Services** to build Web-based Enterprise Systems, using REST and gRPC.

During my career, I've been able to work in different industries, delivering various types of production software, such as Automation Systems, Cloud Governance and Compliance Systems and Highly Scalable Distributed Cloud-based Systems.

Feel free to reach out to me at: `lubeck05@gmail.com`.

**Keep it up, don't give up!**
